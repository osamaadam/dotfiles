# Dotfiles

I'm using [cfgrr](https://github.com/osamaadam/cfgrr) to manage the configuration files.
The `/home` directory is used for display only. You may use `cfgrr` to bulk restore these config files or manually browse the files at `/home` if that's suitable to you.

## Use

- First, you'll need to download `cfgrr`, follow `cfgrr`'s [installation instructions](https://github.com/osamaadam/cfgrr#installation).
- Next, clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:osamaadam/dotfiles.git ~/.config/cfgrr/`
- Finally, run `cfgrr restore` which would prompt you for the files you'd like to restore.
